In this post we will use a library called web3-react in order to connect users to MetaMask or any wallet from the frontend. Web3-react is a simple, powerful framework for building modern Ethereum dApps using React.

## Prerequisites

1. Install [metamask](https://metamask.io/) and create an account. Add the extension to your browser.
2. Create your own React project
3. [ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/): Open source JavaScript Client library which contains the tools to talk to the Ethereum blockchain. (Another very popular option is [web3.js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.5.2/). You can find a comparison of the two [here](https://blog.infura.io/ethereum-javascript-libraries-web3-js-vs-ethers-js-part-i/).)
