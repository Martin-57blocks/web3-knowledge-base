In traditional web applications, users are prompted to sign in with an username and a password. In the decentralized world, DApps need to be given permission to access a userâ€™s wallet in order to enable certain functionality.

## Metamask

MetaMask is a cryptocurrency wallet that enables users to access the Web 3 ecosystem of decentralized applications (dapps). It is one of the most popular wallet solutions, and is accessible via a Chrome extension or a mobile app.

MetaMask injects a global Ethereum API into websites users visit at window.ethereum, which allows the websites to read and request the users' blockchain data.
